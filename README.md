# OfflineChatApp-Java-AWT
A Java AWT project, which was the homework of the class CS102 in Ozyegin University. Application simulates a chat environment by setting random users to online, and choosing random messages from a list with a random delay after each message. To obtain the delay (without delaying/sleeping the whole application), we implemented a basic Multithreading method.
